I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student at Illinois institute of
Technology in Chicago, IL. I am very passionate about engineering and science.
For as long as I can remember I have had a very curious and experimental
nature. Creating, breaking down, and understanding things has always been my
hobby. I believe being an engineer is not just a career, it means being
creative, being a volunteer, and providing sustainable solutions to daily
problems.

Working at the Idea Shop prototyping lab at IIT has helped me explore my passion
for engineering. As student staff, my job is to provide consultancy to students,
staff, and faculty on a project, idea or a design. I walk them through the
basics of design process and help them create a prototype of their design.
Through my work experience I have learned how to work and perform repairs on
several machines like 3-D Printers, Laser Cutters, and Milling machines. I am
also proficient at using different CAD(Computer Aided Design) softwares like
Solidworks, AUTOCAD, AUTODESK INVENTOR, and Rhinoceros.

Besides working at the Idea Shop, I had the opportunity to perform research
under Prof. Mahesh Krishnamurthy on autonomous robotic vehicles. The goal of my
research was to create algorithms that could be easily be implemented on a
robotic vehicle to make it fully autonomous by using couple of range finding
sensors and encoders. I designed a small vehicle to test these
algorithms, and the robot was capable of obstacle detection and avoidance, and
could also navigate to any given nav-point.

In addition to academics, I am also involved in extracurricular activities, that
expand my knowledge in science and engineering. I am the Lead Mechanical
Engineer of NASA Robotic Mining Club(RMC) at IIT. Despite Being a first year
team, we stood third over all in the mining competition. Over forty universities
around the world took part in the competition, and the goal of the competition
is to design a autonomous robot capable of mining in extraterrestrial
environments. NASA simulates a mining environment similar to one on mars where
teams earn design points based on the efficiency of the robot, the weight of the
robot, the data consumed by the robot, and even how weather-proof is the robot!
