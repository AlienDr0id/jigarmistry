    About me
  <p>
I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student at Illinois institute of
Technology in Chicago, IL. I am very passionate about engineering and science.
For as long as I can remember I have had a very curious and experimental
nature. Creating, breaking down, and understanding things has always been my
hobby. I believe being an engineer is not just a career, it means being
creative, being a volunteer, and providing sustainable solutions to daily
problems.
  <p>
Working at the Idea Shop prototyping lab at IIT has helped me explore my passion
for engineering. As student staff, my job is to provide consultancy to students,
staff, and faculty on a project, idea or a design. I walk them through the
design process of prototyping and help them create economic solutions which they
can implement quickly and efficiently. Through my work experience for two years
I have learned how to work on and repair several machines like 3-D Printers,
Laser Cutters, and Milling machines. I also am proficient at using different CAD
softwares like Solidworks, AUTOCAD, AUTODESK INVENTOR, and Rhinoceros.
  <p>
Besides working at the Idea Shop, I had the opportunity to perform research
under Prof. Mahesh Krishnamurthy on autonomous robotic solutions. The goal of my
research was to create a algorithm that could be easily be implemented on a
robotic vehicle to make it fully autonomous with the use couple of range finding
sensors. I designed a prototype robotic vehicle to test these algorithms, and
the robot was capable of obstacle detection and avoidance, and could also
navigate to any given nav-point.
  <p>
In addition to academics, I am also involved in extracurricular activities, that
expand my knowledge in science and engineering. I am the Lead Mechanical
Engineer of NASA Robotic Mining Club(RMC) at IIT. Despite Being a first year
team, we stood third over all in the mining competition. Over forty universities
around the world took part in the competition, and the goal of the competition
is to design a autonomous robot capable of mining in extraterrestrial
environments. NASA simulates a mining environment similar to one on mars where
teams earn design points based on the efficiency of the robot, the weight of the
robot, the data consumed by the robot, and even how weather-proof is the robot!
