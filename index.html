  <p>
  Hello everyone, my name is Jigar Mistry. I am a 3rd year undergrad in
  Mechanical Engineering. I'm from Kenya, and I joined Illinois Tech
  last fall. I am very passionate about engineering and technology.

  I also spend most of time working with my NASA Robotic Mining team on campus
  and work at the Idea Shop. I live in MSV and if anyone wants to chat, get
  food(big time foodie), or even study, feel free to ask.
